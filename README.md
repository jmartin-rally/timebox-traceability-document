timebox-traceability-document
=============================

An updated version of the System Requirement Validation app, with the sdk and added timeboxing.

This version does NOT use tags to decide what a "requirement" is.  Requirements are User Stories that live in the current project (as scoped) and each requirement's child is evaluated against the release/iteration timebox to determine whether to display or not.  

The test case percentage is the percentage of test cases FOR CHILDREN IN TIMEBOX that have passed.  The acceptance rate is for ALL CHILDREN REGARDLESS OF TIMEBOX.
